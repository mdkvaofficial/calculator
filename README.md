# Calculator

This is a simple **calculator application** built using **Svelte.js**. It performs basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The calculator is lightweight, fast, and demonstrates how to build interactive web applications using Svelte.

## Features

- **Addition**: Add two or more numbers.
- **Subtraction**: Subtract one number from another.
- **Multiplication**: Multiply numbers together.
- **Division**: Divide one number by another.
- **Clear**: Reset the calculator display and start a new calculation.
